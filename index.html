			<h1>Welcome</h1>
			<p>Hey, I am Garry. I am a software engineer and computer science major from University of California, Irvine (UCI) in 2018. I work as an instructor at Caustics Digital Academy teaching Java, Python, 2D game design using clickteam fusion, and Android. I also work at Kulicke &amp; Soffa as a Consumables Software Development Intern integrating software with industry grade hardware and creating a GUI using python to allow engineers with little to no training to operate the machinery. I know how to program in Python, Java, C, C++, Lisp, Prolog, HTML, CSS, x86 assembly, Android, MySQL, PHP, and Rails. Currently, I am working with a group of UCI students creating a web application using Rails and MySQL to collect the demographics of video games for UCI researchers to support claims and evidence. I am also working on a web application that will test users in their ability to brainstorm ideas with Team Aivyl.</p>
